### Brand Consistency

```
You:   "Import my brand from https://youtube.com/@mychannel"
Agent: Imported from YouTube: primary #1a73e8, secondary #ff6f00,
       identity: "Tech educator focused on practical tutorials"
       Applied to your brand kit. All future videos will use these settings.
```

### Batch Processing

```
You:   "Process all .mp4 files in ~/recordings/ as youtube videos"
Agent: Found 5 files. This will consume 5 API credits. Proceed?
You:   "Yes"
Agent: Processing 5 videos... [████████░░] 3/5 complete
```

### Fire-and-Forget with Webhooks

```
You:   "Upload this video and send results to https://my-server.com/callback"
Agent: Uploaded with webhook. You'll receive a signed callback at
       project.completed - no need to poll.
```

### Re-render Without Re-upload

```
You:   "Add subtitles to that last video"
Agent: Re-rendering with subtitles enabled. First re-render is free!
       No re-upload needed - reusing existing analysis.
```
